# Introducing Prakriti Shrestha
This website contains a short introduction of myself.

### Research Interests and Experience 
My main research interests are in the sustainability of health programs, especially from a global governance and decolonization perspective. I have a lot of experience using Stata to conduct data analysis but have only used R in some classes. 

### Fun facts about me 
1. I moved over 8000 miles from Kathmandu, Nepal to Grinnell, Iowa for College.
2. I had an Ekiben neighborhood bird on a bun as a birthday cake for my 25th birthday.
3. I got hit by a bat at an Orioles game (like the animal bat).
4. I lived in the UK (Epsom, Newcastle, and Liverpool) between the ages of 9-12 and had a British accent for those years.
5. I am absolutely obsessed with dogs and have two dogs in Nepal, a 2 year old German Shephard and a 12 year old Lhasa Apso and miss them terribly. My boyfriend's dog Leo and neighbor's dog Kirby keep me company in Baltimore.
