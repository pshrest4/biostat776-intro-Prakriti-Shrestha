# Introducing Prakriti Shrestha
This website contains a short introduction of myself.

## About me
I am a first year PhD student in the Department of International Health in the Health Systems Program. I am originally from Kathmandu, Nepal but I have lived in Baltimore and worked or studied at Hopkins for about 6 years now. I first started working with the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at the JH School of Medicine and then went on to get my MSPH in International Health in the Health Systems Program.

### Research Interests and Experience 
My main research interests are in the sustainability of health programs, especially from a global governance and decolonization perspective. I have a lot of experience using Stata to conduct data analysis but have only used R in some classes. 

### Fun facts about me 
1. I moved over 8000 miles from Kathmandu, Nepal to Grinnell, Iowa for College.
2. I had an Ekiben neighborhood bird on a bun as a birthday cake for my 25th birthday.
3. I got hit by a bat at an Orioles game (like the animal bat).
4. I lived in the UK (Epsom, Newcastle, and Liverpool) between the ages of 9-12 and had a British accent for those years.
5. I am absolutely obsessed with dogs and have two dogs in Nepal, a 2 year old German Shephard and a 12 year old Lhasa Apso and miss them terribly. My boyfriend's dog Leo and neighbor's dog Kirby keep me company in Baltimore.

## Learning goals
I am looking forward to learning how to use more R effectively than I do now!
